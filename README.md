### Customer Churned based on Payment Methods


In order to generate a high-risk customer churn, we focused in this following metrics key:
- Churn Rate: The percentage of people left to subscribes Databel.

Churn Rate:
- Customers with monthly contract types dominate the customer base, accounting for 51.01% of all customers. Among these, approximately half (46.29%) have churned.
- California state is the higest customer churned.
- Direct debit payments are the most popular option for customers, but half of them eventually stop.
- Customers who choose the monthly contract type have the highest churn rate. Among these contracts, those who do not subscribe as a group or are subscribed individually have a higher churn rate compared to those who subscribe as a group.
- Investigate more about the package suits with customer need.
- Pay attention to certain complains from customers as customer with more than one call to customer service likely churned.

Recommendation:
- Targeted Campaigns: Prioritize marketing campaigns aimed at Month-to-Month contract customers, as they contribute significantly to customer churn. It's essential to consider competitive offerings that may appeal to these customers.
- Payment Methods: Focus on customers who use direct debit for payments within the Month-to-Month contract category, as this group shows a high tendency to churn.
Special Offers for Seniors: Develop special product offerings for Month-to-Month contract customers aged over 60, since this demographic has a notably high churn rate. Explore the potential benefits of transitioning this segment to yearly contracts.
- Personalized Product Recommendations: Recommend the best products based on individual customer needs, such as whether they require unlimited data or international calling options. This approach should reflect in their monthly charges, and consider offering downgrades if certain features are unnecessary.
- Group Packages: Encourage single customers to consider group packages, which may provide better value and reduce churn.

New insight to remember:
- Enhanced Customer Service: Improve customer service responsiveness by actively listening to complaints and providing polite, effective solutions. Notably, customers who leave often contact customer service multiple times, indicating a need for better engagement and resolution strategies.
