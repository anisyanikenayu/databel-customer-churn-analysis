## Project Background
Databel is a telecommunications company that has acquired 6,687 customers; however, it faces a challenge with a churn rate of 26.86%. The upcoming project will concentrate on identifying customer pain points and developing optimal solutions to address these issues. By understanding these challenges, the company will have a framework for evaluating its products and services, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and retention.

## Executive Summary

## Insights Deep-Dive
### Customer Churned based on Contract Type
- Based on the three charts, most customers purchase the month-to-month package, with an average churn rate approaching 50% across all age groups. On the other hand, customers with a one-year contract are significantly fewer in number, but their churn rate tends to require evaluation, ranging from the low teens to nearly 25%. In contrast, the two-year contract has a higher number of customers compared to the one-year contract, and its churn rate is remarkably low across all age groups.
The trend observed in month-to-month and one-year contracts shows a sharp increase in churn rate among customers aged over 60. Younger to middle-aged customers seem to prefer cheaper products with shorter commitments, making them more likely to switch providers when they find monthly plans offering better value. Meanwhile, older customers tend to avoid frequent changes and prefer stability; once they find a product that suits their needs, they are more likely to remain loyal customers.
